BehavioralBiometryUniProject

Drawing inspiration from how some Polish banks have approached behavioural authentication, I created a simple simulation of an application to showcase how this technology might work in practice.

The project consists of the following components:

    Python Notebook – used to train machine learning models with the Isolation Forest algorithm. The training was performed using the Balabit Mouse Dynamics Challenge dataset.

    Python Script – a simple GUI application demonstrating what the behavioural-based authorization process could look like for a user.

    ZIP Archive – contains the trained ML model weights.

    Note: To run the application correctly, make sure to set the model_dir variable to the path of your local directory containing the model files.
